## Summary

Humans using Natural Languages have commanded computers using computer signals to process their tasks. However, the computers can’t understand the Natural Languages directly so they have to learn the machines’ languages in order to deal with computers. Even if they know how to handle computers, it’s too expensive for them to learn the way in terms of time and costs. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to enable computers to understand the signals written in English and visualize Finite State Machine including matched patterns in the description in order to help them learn. We make a Verilog code to generate Timing Diagram as a VCD format file by using ModelSim, a visualization tool for Embedded System, then we make a program to translate the VCD format file into another Verilog code for Finite State Machine. The VCD format file and the result code in Verilog are written according to i2c protocol from a data transmission point of view. As a result, it is successful to change the VCD format file into the result code obeying Verilog grammar. Natural Languages can be changed into Timing Diagram and it can be also changed into Finite State Machine, with this, computers understand the Finite State Machine. We accomplish the purpose changing Timing Diagram into Finite State Machine. If we have parsed sentences expressive of computer signals and process them, we will be able to reveal that computers directly understand Natural Languages depicting computer signals.
